    <p>What is error in a computer? <code>ERROR</code>, <code>MISTAKE</code>, and <code>MALFUCTION </code>A computer error is a mistake or malfunction that occurs in a computer system, causing it to behave in an unexpected or
    incorrect way. Errors can manifest in many forms, such as software glitches or hardware malfunctions, and can lead to
    data loss, system failure, or programs crashing.
    Here are some types of computer errors:
    Software errors
    The most common type of error, often caused by mistakes in the source code or design of a program. Software updates or
    patches can often fix these errors.
    Hardware errors
    Caused by defects in the computer's hardware or any hardware connected to it. Most hardware errors require replacing the
    defective hardware, but some can be fixed with firmware updates.
    System errors
    Unexpected events that occur while a program is running, such as memory faults, network failures, file corruption, or
    hardware malfunctions. System errors can cause programs to crash, freeze, or produce incorrect results.
    Bugs
    Errors, flaws, or failures in a computer program or system that cause it to produce unexpected or incorrect results.
    Bugs can have subtle effects or cause the program to crash or freeze the computer.</p>

    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document
    written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a
    cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]
    
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This
    separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation;
    provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to
    share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
    structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share
    the file and its formatting.
    
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for
    different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on
    Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
    device.[5]
    
    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one
    declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
    
    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css
    is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS
    documents.[6]
    
    In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also
    used in the GTK widget toolkit.</p>

    <h1>Who is Martin Fowler?</h1>
    <p>Martin Fowler (18 December 1963) is a British software developer,[2] author and international public speaker on software
    development, specialising in object-oriented analysis and design, UML, patterns, and agile software development
    methodologies, including extreme programming.
    
    His 1999 book Refactoring popularised the practice of code refactoring.[3] In 2004 he introduced a new architectural
    pattern, called Presentation Model (PM).Fowler was born and grew up in Walsall, England, where he went to Queen Mary's Grammar School for his secondary
    education. He graduated at University College London in 1986. In 1994, he moved to the United States, where he lives
    near Boston, Massachusetts in the suburb of Melrose.[1]
    
    Fowler started working with software in the early 1980s. Out of university in 1986 he started working in software
    development for Coopers & Lybrand until 1991.[5] In 2000 he joined ThoughtWorks, a systems integration and consulting
    company,[1] where he was Chief Scientist.[6]
    
    Fowler has written nine books on the topic of software development. He is a member of the Agile Alliance and helped
    create the Manifesto for Agile Software Development in 2001, along with 16 fellow signatories.[7] He maintains a bliki,
    a mix of blog and wiki. He popularised the term Dependency Injection as a form of Inversion of Control.</p>
